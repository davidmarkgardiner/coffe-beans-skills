# Workflow Validation Test

This file validates that our automated workflow pipeline works end-to-end.

## Purpose
Test the complete automation from PR creation through approval:
1. Fast pre-checks (type check, lint, build, unit tests)
2. Firebase preview deployment
3. E2E tests against live preview URL
4. Code review with E2E results
5. Automated approval or @claude feedback loop

## Expected Outcome
- ✅ All workflows execute successfully
- ✅ E2E tests pass against Firebase preview
- ✅ Code review scores ≥85
- ✅ PR approved automatically
