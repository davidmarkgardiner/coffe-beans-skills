# Code Review Workflow Comparison

## Problem
The `claude-code-review-custom.yml` workflow is slow due to:
1. **Massive prompt** (150+ lines of instructions)
2. **Long wait time** (up to 15 minutes waiting for Firebase preview)
3. **Extensive analysis** required across 6 detailed dimensions
4. **Progress tracking overhead** (creates/updates tracking comments)

## Solutions

### Option 1: Keep Current (Comprehensive)
**File**: `claude-code-review-custom.yml.disabled`

**Pros:**
- Thorough, detailed reviews
- 6-dimension scoring framework
- E2E test integration
- Iteration tracking
- Comprehensive feedback

**Cons:**
- ❌ Slow (3-5 minutes for review alone)
- ❌ High token usage (~10k-20k tokens per review)
- ❌ Long prompts = slower processing
- ❌ Waits up to 15 minutes for tests

**Best for**: Production PRs, major features, security-critical changes

### Option 2: Fast Review (Recommended for Testing)
**File**: `claude-code-review-fast.yml.disabled`

**Pros:**
- ✅ Much faster (30-90 seconds)
- ✅ Minimal prompt (20 lines vs 150+)
- ✅ Lower token usage (~2k-5k tokens)
- ✅ No progress tracking overhead
- ✅ No waiting for other workflows
- ✅ Still provides scored decisions

**Cons:**
- Less detailed feedback
- No E2E test integration
- No iteration tracking
- Simpler scoring framework

**Best for**: Development/testing workflows, minor changes, quick iterations

## Recommendations

### For Current Testing (PR #12)
Use **Fast Review** to:
- Validate workflow mechanics work correctly
- Save tokens during development
- Get quick feedback cycles
- Test the scoring/approval logic

### For Production
Use **Comprehensive Review** when:
- Deploying to production
- Reviewing security-critical changes
- Large feature PRs
- Need detailed audit trail

## Speed Improvements Applied to Both

Even the comprehensive review can be sped up:

1. **Remove wait-for-tests job** (parallel instead of sequential)
   ```yaml
   # Before: claude-review waits for tests (adds 3-10 min)
   needs: wait-for-tests

   # After: Run in parallel, check test status in prompt
   # (No needs clause)
   ```

2. **Disable progress tracking** for speed
   ```yaml
   track_progress: false  # Saves 10-30 seconds
   ```

3. **Reduce prompt size**
   - Keep only essential instructions
   - Remove examples and verbose explanations
   - Focus on scoring criteria

4. **Use focused checkout**
   ```yaml
   fetch-depth: 1  # Instead of 0 (full history)
   ```

## Token Cost Comparison

| Workflow | Prompt Size | Avg Tokens | Time |
|----------|-------------|------------|------|
| Comprehensive | ~3k tokens | 15-25k | 3-5 min |
| Fast | ~500 tokens | 3-8k | 1-2 min |

## Implementation

To enable Fast Review:
```bash
mv .github/workflows/claude-code-review-fast.yml.disabled \
   .github/workflows/claude-code-review-fast.yml
```

To enable Comprehensive Review:
```bash
mv .github/workflows/claude-code-review-custom.yml.disabled \
   .github/workflows/claude-code-review-custom.yml
```

## Conclusion

For PR #12 workflow validation, use the **Fast Review** to:
- Conserve tokens
- Speed up testing cycles
- Validate approval automation works

For production use, consider the **Comprehensive Review** for:
- Better quality assurance
- Detailed feedback
- E2E test integration
