# Claude Automated Development & Review Workflow Guide

## Overview

This repository uses an automated development cycle where Claude Code implements features and reviews code, creating an iterative improvement loop until quality standards are met.

1. User creates issue with "@claude" mention
   ‚Üì
2. claude.yml: Claude Implementation Agent
   - Reads issue requirements
   - Implements solution on feature branch
   - Runs tests
   - Creates PR with proper description
   ‚Üì
3. playwright.yml: Automated Test Suite (runs in parallel)

## How to Use

### Creating a New Feature

1. **Create an issue** with clear requirements:

```markdown
Title: Add shopping cart functionality

Body:
Implement a shopping cart feature with:
- Add/remove items
- Update quantities
- Calculate totals
- Persist to localStorage

@claude please implement this
```

2. **Claude implements** automatically:
   - Creates feature branch
   - Writes code
   - Adds tests
   - Creates PR

3. **Automated review** begins:
   - Review agent analyzes code
   - Provides scored feedback
   - Tags @claude if changes needed

4. **Iterative improvement** (if score < 85):
   - Claude fixes issues
   - Pushes updates
   - Re-review triggers automatically
   - Continues up to 3 iterations

5. **Merge** when approved (score >= 85)

### Responding to Review Feedback

You can also manually guide Claude:

```markdown
# In a PR review comment:
@claude The authentication middleware needs to handle expired tokens better.
Please add:
1. Token expiry check
2. Automatic refresh logic
3. Tests for expired token scenarios
```

### Manual Review Requests

```markdown
# In any PR comment:
@claude Please review the performance of the database queries in src/api/products.ts
```

## Test Requirements

### Automated Testing Philosophy

**Tests are a quality gate, not a blocker.** The workflow is designed to:
1. Run tests automatically on every PR
2. Report results to reviewers
3. Influence the review score
4. Guide Claude to fix failing tests

### Test Status Impact on Score

| Test Status | Impact | Review Action |
|-------------|--------|---------------|
| ‚úÖ All pass | +0 | Normal review scoring |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è Some fail | -10 to -20 pts | Claude tagged to fix failures |
| ‚ùå All fail | -20 pts | Likely triggers REQUEST_CHANGES |
| ‚è±Ô∏è Timeout | Warning only | Review notes concern |

### Available Test Commands

```bash
# Coffee Website React
cd coffee-website-react

# Inventory management tests
npm run test:inventory

# Checkout flow tests
npm run test:checkout

# Stripe integration tests
npm run test:stripe

# Lint check
npm run lint

# Build check
npm run build

# Playwright E2E (if configured)
npx playwright test
```

### Adding Playwright E2E Tests

To add Playwright tests to your app:

1. **Install Playwright:**
   ```bash
   cd coffee-website-react
   npm install --save-dev @playwright/test
   npx playwright install chromium
   ```

2. **Create config:**
   ```bash
   # Creates playwright.config.ts
   npm init playwright@latest
   ```

3. **Write tests in `tests/` directory:**
   ```typescript
   // tests/homepage.spec.ts
   import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

   test('homepage loads successfully', async ({ page }) => {
     await page.goto('http://localhost:5173');
     await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Coffee/);
   });

   test('can add item to cart', async ({ page }) => {
     await page.goto('http://localhost:5173');
     await page.click('button:has-text("Add to Cart")');
     await expect(page.locator('.cart-count')).toHaveText('1');
   });
   ```

4. **Tests will automatically run** on next PR

### Test Artifacts

After each test run, download artifacts from GitHub Actions:
- **Playwright Report** - HTML report with screenshots and videos
- **Test Results** - JSON test results and coverage
- **Retention**: 30 days

## Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Be specific in issues**: Clear requirements lead to better implementations
2. **Trust the process**: Let the automated review cycle complete before intervening
3. **Review approved PRs**: Even with score >= 85, do a final human review for critical features
4. **Monitor iterations**: If 3 iterations don't resolve issues, the problem may need human insight

### For Claude Implementation Agent

1. **Always create feature branches**: Never push directly to main
2. **Write comprehensive tests**: Aim for good coverage from the start
3. **Follow CLAUDE.md**: Repository conventions and patterns
4. **Clear PR descriptions**: Explain what, why, and how

### For Claude Review Agent

1. **Be constructive**: Focus on improvements, not criticism
2. **Reference specific files/lines**: Use `file.ts:42` format
3. **Explain principles**: Don't just say "fix this", explain why
4. **Score consistently**: Use the rubric faithfully

## Troubleshooting

### Claude isn't responding to @mentions

- Check that the mention is exactly `@claude` (lowercase)
- Verify the workflow files are in `.github/workflows/`
- Check Actions tab for workflow run status
- Ensure `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` secret is set

### Reviews aren't triggering

- Confirm PR is not a draft
- Check that PR is not from dependabot
- Verify workflow has necessary permissions
- Check Actions tab for errors

### Infinite review loop

- Check iteration counter in review comments
- Should auto-stop at 3 iterations
- If stuck, manually approve or request changes

### Low scores on good code

- Review agent may be too strict
- Adjust scoring guidelines in workflow
- Consider lowering APPROVE threshold (currently 85)

## Configuration

### Adjusting Quality Thresholds

Edit `.github/workflows/claude-code-review-custom.yml`:

```yaml
# Current thresholds:
# 85-100: APPROVE
# 70-84: REQUEST_CHANGES
# 0-69: BLOCK

# To be more lenient:
# 75-100: APPROVE
# 60-74: REQUEST_CHANGES
# 0-59: BLOCK
```

### Changing Iteration Limit

Edit `.github/workflows/claude-code-review-custom.yml`:

```yaml
MAX_ITERATIONS: 3  # Change to 5 for more attempts
```

### Disabling Automated Reviews

Rename or disable the review workflow:

```bash
# Temporarily disable
mv .github/workflows/claude-code-review-custom.yml \
   .github/workflows/claude-code-review-custom.yml.disabled

# Re-enable
mv .github/workflows/claude-code-review-custom.yml.disabled \
   .github/workflows/claude-code-review-custom.yml
```

### Adding More Review Criteria

Edit the prompt in `claude-code-review-custom.yml` to add new dimensions:

```yaml
- Accessibility: XX/10
- Documentation: XX/10
```

## Security Notes

### Blocked Commands

The implementation agent cannot execute:
- `rm -rf*` - Recursive force deletion
- `sudo*` - Privilege escalation
- `chmod*` - Permission changes
- `chown*` - Ownership changes

### Safe Operations

Allowed operations include:
- File read/write/copy/move
- Git operations (branch, commit, push)
- Package management (npm, pip, etc.)
- Build and test commands
- GitHub CLI operations

### Secrets Management

- Never commit secrets or API keys
- Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive data
- Claude will flag hardcoded credentials in reviews

## Workflow Metrics

Track your automated workflow success:

```bash
# Count automated approvals
gh pr list --state closed --json reviews --jq '
  [.[] | select(.reviews[].body | contains("APPROVED"))] | length
'

# Average review iterations
gh pr list --json comments --jq '
  [.[] | [.comments[] | select(.body | contains("Review Score"))] | length] |
  add / length
'
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to consider:

- [ ] Automated benchmark comparisons
- [ ] Visual regression testing integration
- [ ] Dependency update automation
- [ ] Performance budget enforcement
- [ ] Accessibility testing integration
- [ ] Security scanning integration (SAST/DAST)
