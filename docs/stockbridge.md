## Historical Background

Stockbridge began as a small village on the outskirts of Edinburgh, officially becoming part of the city in the early to mid 19th century. The area’s name comes from a “stock bridge” (timber bridge) that crossed the Water of Leith. In the 18th century, it was famous for St Bernard’s Well, where Edinburgh’s elite would visit for the reputed healing properties of the well’s waters, and the Greek temple-like pump house built by Alexander Nasmyth still stands today.[edinburghnews.scotsman+4](https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/heritage-and-retro/heritage/25-pictures-of-stockbridge-from-the-1950s-and-1960s-3470072)​

A key figure in Stockbridge’s development was the Scottish artist Sir Henry Raeburn, who purchased St Bernard’s estate and planned much of the elegant Georgian architecture, including the iconic houses on Ann Street and Dean Terrace. By the nineteenth century, Stockbridge’s riverside location made it ideal for mills and industry, which attracted skilled workers and artisans – leading to the construction of the distinctive Stockbridge Colonies, a pioneering scheme to provide affordable, well-built homes for the working class.[weewalkingtours+4](https://www.weewalkingtours.com/post/2019/11/18/stockbridge-edinburgh-trekking-the-markets-mews-lanes)​ This spirit of craftsmanship inspired the founders of Stockbridge Coffee Co. when they launched the roastery in 2005, setting the stage for the brand’s now 20-year legacy in 2025.

## Stockbridge Today

Modern Stockbridge has a strong village atmosphere: cobbled lanes, independent boutiques, vibrant markets (the Stockbridge Market is a local hub with artisan foods, crafts and street stalls), and a close-knit community spirit. Circus Lane is among the city’s most photogenic streets, and Raeburn Place remains a shopping and foodie destination.[wandersomewhere+3](https://www.wandersomewhere.com/travel/stockbridge-edinburgh)​ Stockbridge Coffee Co.’s flagship café is nestled along this route, flying the aurora beam logo and serving seasonal roasts that nod to the area’s creative pulse.

It’s also known as one of Edinburgh’s most desirable districts, often appearing on lists of best places to live thanks to its blend of architectural beauty, green spaces, riverside walks, and buzzing cafes and restaurants. The Stockbridge Colonies in particular are a testament to the area’s social reform history, prioritising decent housing as a route to healthier, happier lives.[stockbridgelocal+3](https://www.stockbridgelocal.co.uk/)​
