# Lessons Learned - AI Content Manager

Track discoveries, gotchas, and optimizations as you implement and use the AI Content Manager skill.

## Initial Setup (2025-10-25)

### What Worked Well

✅ **Flat Collection Structure**
- Using `content-photos` and `content-videos` as top-level collections (not subcollections)
- Easier to query and manage
- Simpler security rules

✅ **Test Scripts**
- `npm run test:content` for photos (~30 seconds)
- `npm run test:video` for videos (~10-15 minutes)
- `npm run upload:content` for Firebase upload
- All worked smoothly once environment variables were set

✅ **Fallback Query Pattern**
- Added fallback for when Firestore indexes are building
- Allows immediate use while indexes propagate
- Automatically switches to indexed queries when ready

### Challenges Encountered

❌ **Firestore Security Rules - Too Restrictive Initially**
- **Issue**: Rules blocked reads with `allow read: if resource.data.status == 'active'`
- **Problem**: Can't check `resource.data` before document is fetched
- **Fix**: Changed to `allow read: if true` for testing (will secure with Cloud Functions later)

❌ **Firestore Indexes Not Deployed**
- **Issue**: Queries failed with "requires an index" error
- **Problem**: Forgot to deploy `firestore.indexes.json`
- **Fix**: `firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes`
- **Note**: Indexes take 1-2 minutes to build after deployment

❌ **Collection Path Confusion**
- **Issue**: Tried using subcollections like `content/videos/{id}` which requires odd segments
- **Problem**: Firestore paths must have even segments for subcollections
- **Fix**: Use flat collections: `content-videos/{id}` and `content-photos/{id}`

### Optimizations Discovered

⚡ **Preloading Strategy**
- `preloadNext: true` in `useContentRotation` hook
- Loads next content in background for smooth transitions
- Essential for seamless rotation experience

⚡ **Framer Motion Transitions**
- 1-second crossfade between content items
- `AnimatePresence` with `mode="wait"` for smooth transitions
- Video elements require `key` prop for proper re-rendering

## Content Generation

### Successful Prompts

**Autumn Video (Test):**
```
"Warm cinematic video of a latte with autumn leaf latte art on a wooden table
surrounded by fallen autumn leaves (maple, oak). Golden hour lighting, cozy
Edinburgh cafe, rich amber and orange tones. Professional videography, 16:9
landscape, 6-second seamless loop."
```
✅ Generated high-quality, brand-appropriate content
✅ Golden hour lighting matched seasonal aesthetic
✅ Looped seamlessly

**Autumn Photo (Test):**
```
"Professional autumn photograph of a cappuccino on a wooden table with scattered
autumn leaves, warm scarf partially visible, golden afternoon light through window.
Cozy, inviting fall mood, Edinburgh cafe setting, shallow depth of field, 16:9 composition."
```
✅ Perfect composition and lighting
✅ Brand colors aligned (warm tones, natural)

### API Insights

**Veo Video Generation:**
- **Generation time**: 10-15 minutes average
- **Cost per video**: ~$0.10-0.30 (check Google AI Studio for exact pricing)
- **Model used**: `veo-3.1-fast-generate-preview`
- **Resolution**: 720p (upgrade to 1080p for production)
- **Aspect ratio**: 16:9 works perfectly for hero backgrounds

**Imagen Photo Generation:**
- **Generation time**: 10-30 seconds
- **Cost per photo**: ~$0.02-0.04
- **Model used**: `imagen-4.0-generate-001`
- **Format**: JPEG works well, smaller file sizes than PNG

## Firebase Deployment

### Security Rules (Testing Phase)

**Current Setup (Open for Testing):**
```javascript
// Firestore
match /content-videos/{contentId} {
  allow read: if true;  // Public read
  allow write: if true; // TODO: Secure for production
}

// Storage
match /content/{contentType}/{season}/{fileName} {
  allow read: if true;
  allow write: if true; // TODO: Secure for production
}
```

**Deployment Commands:**
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,firestore:indexes,storage
```

**Important Notes:**
- Deploy indexes BEFORE deploying app code
- Indexes take 1-2 minutes to build
- Use fallback queries during index build time

### Storage Structure

**Working Structure:**
```
Firebase Storage:
  /content
    /videos
      /autumn
        autumn-video-20251025T154658.mp4
    /photos
      /autumn
        autumn-photo-20251025T150958.jpg

Firestore:
  /content-videos
    /autumn-video-20251025T154658
      - type: "video"
      - season: "autumn"
      - status: "active"
      - url: "https://..."

  /content-photos
    /autumn-photo-20251025T150958
      - type: "photo"
      - season: "autumn"
      - status: "active"
      - url: "https://..."
```

---

## Hero Component Integration

### What Worked

✅ **Video Element Configuration**
```tsx
<motion.video
  key={currentContent.id}  // Essential for re-rendering
  autoPlay
  loop
  muted                     // Required for autoplay
  playsInline               // Required for mobile
  className="... blur-[2px]" // Blur for cinematic effect
/>
```

✅ **Fallback to Static Image**
- Always have fallback to Unsplash or static image
- Prevents blank hero if content fetch fails
- Graceful degradation

### Content Rotation Settings

**Optimal Settings (Found Through Testing):**
```tsx
useContentRotation({
  contentType: 'video',
  rotationInterval: 30000,  // 30 seconds
  preloadNext: true,        // Essential for smooth transitions
})
```

**Why 30 Seconds:**
- Long enough to appreciate the content
- Short enough to maintain interest
- Matches typical user scroll behavior

---

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: "Missing or insufficient permissions"

**Symptoms:**
- Error in browser console: `FirebaseError: Missing or insufficient permissions`
- Content not loading

**Solutions:**
1. Check Firestore rules allow public read: `allow read: if true`
2. Deploy rules: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`
3. Wait 30 seconds for rules to propagate

### Issue: "The query requires an index"

**Symptoms:**
- Error: `The query requires an index. You can create it here: ...`
- Content not loading

**Solutions:**
1. Deploy indexes: `firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes`
2. Wait 1-2 minutes for indexes to build
3. Use fallback query pattern (implemented in `contentService.ts`)
4. Check Firebase Console > Firestore > Indexes for build status

### Issue: Showing Unsplash instead of generated content

**Checklist:**
1. ✅ Video uploaded to Firebase Storage?
2. ✅ Firestore document created in `content-videos` collection?
3. ✅ Document has `status: "active"` and correct `season`?
4. ✅ Firestore rules allow read?
5. ✅ Indexes deployed and built?
6. ✅ Browser hard-refreshed (Cmd+Shift+R)?

**Debug:**
```bash
# Check what's in Firestore
npx tsx scripts/debug-content.ts

# Check browser console for errors
# Open DevTools (F12) → Console tab
```

### Issue: Video not playing

**Common Causes:**
1. Missing `muted` attribute (autoplay requires muted)
2. Missing `playsInline` (required for mobile)
3. Missing `key` prop (React won't re-render without it)
4. Wrong MIME type (should be `video/mp4`)

**Fix:**
```tsx
<video
  key={currentContent.id}  // Add this
  autoPlay
  loop
  muted          // Add this
  playsInline    // Add this
  src={currentContent.url}
/>
```

## Recommended Configurations

Based on testing, these are the recommended settings:

### Content Rotation
```typescript
rotationInterval: 30000  // 30 seconds - sweet spot
maxPoolSize: 10          // Enough variety without overwhelming
preloadNext: true        // Essential for smooth transitions
```

### Generation Schedule
```yaml
schedule: 'Sunday 3:00 AM UTC'  # Low-traffic time
weeklyVideos: 1                  # Manageable and cost-effective
weeklyPhotos: 2                  # Provides variety
```

### Firestore Indexes
```json
{
  "collectionGroup": "videos",
  "fields": [
    { "fieldPath": "season", "order": "ASCENDING" },
    { "fieldPath": "status", "order": "ASCENDING" },
    { "fieldPath": "createdAt", "order": "DESCENDING" }
  ]
}
```

---

## GitHub Actions Automation (2025-10-25)

### What Worked Well

✅ **Simplified Orchestration Script**
- Created `generate-weekly-content.ts` that uses existing tested scripts
- Calls `test:content`, `test:video`, and `upload:content` npm scripts
- Much simpler than creating separate scripts for each step
- Easy to test locally before running in GitHub Actions

✅ **Workflow Configuration**
- Scheduled for Sunday 3:00 AM UTC (low-traffic time)
- Manual trigger with optional parameters (season, video count, photo count)
- 30-minute timeout accommodates slow Veo video generation
- Clear logging and progress reporting

✅ **Environment Variables**
- Used GitHub Secrets for all sensitive data
- Same VITE_ prefix as local .env for consistency
- Separate GEMINI_API_KEY secret (not VITE_ prefixed since it's server-side)

### Challenges Encountered

❌ **Initial Workflow Complexity**
- **Issue**: First draft had 5+ separate steps with custom scripts
- **Problem**: Each script needed to be created and tested separately
- **Fix**: Simplified to use existing npm scripts in orchestration script
- **Result**: Much easier to maintain and test

❌ **Veo Video Generation Response Structure (RESOLVED)**
- **Issue**: Video generation completes but "No download link in response"
- **Problem**: `operation.response?.generatedVideos?.[0]?.video?.uri` is undefined
- **SDK Version**: @google/genai v1.27.0
- **Model**: veo-3.1-fast-generate-preview
- **Fix**: The response structure was actually correct - issue resolved itself on retry
- **Status**: ✅ WORKING - Videos generate successfully in ~1 minute
- **Result**: Both photos (~30s) and videos (~1min) now working in GitHub Actions

❌ **Firebase Production Deployment - Cloud Run Permissions**
- **Issue**: Deployment fails with `Permission 'run.services.get' denied on resource 'coffee-copilot-backend'`
- **Problem**: firebase.json has Cloud Run rewrite, but service accounts lacked `run.viewer` permission
- **Root Cause**: Firebase Hosting verifies Cloud Run services exist before deploying
- **Fix**: Grant `roles/run.viewer` to both service accounts:
  - `github-actions-sa@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
  - `firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
    --member="serviceAccount:SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL" \
    --role="roles/run.viewer"
  ```
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Production deployments now succeed

### Setup Instructions

**Local Testing:**
```bash
# Test the full workflow locally
npm run generate:weekly

# With custom parameters
npm run generate:weekly -- --season=winter --videos=2 --photos=3
```

**GitHub Secrets Required:**
See `references/github-secrets-setup.md` for complete setup instructions.

Quick setup using GitHub CLI:
```bash
gh secret set GEMINI_API_KEY --body "YOUR_API_KEY"
gh secret set VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY --body "YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY"
# ... (see full list in github-secrets-setup.md)
```

**Trigger Workflow Manually:**
```bash
# Via GitHub CLI
gh workflow run generate-weekly-content.yml

# Check status
gh run list --workflow=generate-weekly-content.yml
```

**Scheduled Run:**
- Runs automatically every Sunday at 3:00 AM UTC
- Generates 1 video + 2 photos
- Auto-detects current season
- Uploads to Firebase with status: "active"
- Content appears in rotation immediately
