## Prompt Testing & Iteration

- [ ] Emotion/mood is clear and appropriate
- [ ] No distracting elements or text overlays
- [ ] Composition follows rule of thirds or balanced design

### Iteration Tips

If generated content doesn't match expectations:

1. **Too generic**: Add more specific Edinburgh/Stockbridge details
2. **Wrong aesthetic**: Emphasize "professional food photography" or "cinematic"
3. **Poor lighting**: Specify exact lighting (golden hour, soft window light, etc.)
4. **Cluttered**: Simplify prompt, focus on hero subject
5. **Wrong mood**: Add emotional descriptors (cozy, fresh, vibrant, etc.)
