# Coffee Copilot Deployment Checklist

This checklist ensures a successful deployment of your Coffee Copilot to production.

## Pre-Deployment

### Environment Configuration

- [ ] Create production `.env` file with all required variables
- [ ] Set `NODE_ENV=production`
- [ ] Configure `OPENAI_API_KEY` with production key
- [ ] Set up vector database credentials (Pinecone/Qdrant/pgvector)
- [ ] Configure `GITHUB_TOKEN` with appropriate scopes
- [ ] Set `GITHUB_REPO` to your repository
- [ ] Configure `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` for CORS
- [ ] Add `.env` to `.gitignore` (verify it's not in git)

### Security

- [ ] Enable HTTPS/TLS for all endpoints
- [ ] Implement rate limiting on `/api/chat`
- [ ] Add authentication middleware
- [ ] Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- [ ] Never expose API keys to frontend
- [ ] Set up CORS with specific allowed origins (not `*`)
- [ ] Implement CSRF protection if using cookies
- [ ] Add request size limits to prevent abuse
- [ ] Set up security headers (helmet.js)
- [ ] Review and minimize API token permissions

Example security middleware:
```typescript
import helmet from 'helmet';
import rateLimit from 'express-rate-limit';

app.use(helmet());

const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // 100 requests per window
  message: 'Too many requests, please try again later.'
});

app.use('/api/chat', limiter);
```

### Database

- [ ] Configure auto-scaling if needed
- [ ] Set up CDN for frontend assets
- [ ] Configure DNS records
- [ ] Set up SSL/TLS certificates

### Deployment Steps

- [ ] Deploy backend to production
- [ ] Verify backend health check
- [ ] Deploy frontend widget
- [ ] Test widget connection to backend
- [ ] Verify CORS configuration
- [ ] Test complete user flow in production
- [ ] Monitor initial deployment for errors

### Monitoring & Observability

- [ ] Set up application monitoring (Datadog, New Relic, etc.)
- [ ] Configure error tracking (Sentry, Rollbar)
- [ ] Set up logging aggregation (LogDNA, Papertrail)
- [ ] Create dashboards for key metrics
- [ ] Set up alerts for critical issues
- [ ] Monitor API usage and costs
- [ ] Track chat session analytics

Key metrics to monitor:
```typescript
// Example metrics to track
{
  "chat_requests_total": 1234,
  "chat_requests_successful": 1200,
  "chat_requests_failed": 34,
  "average_response_time_ms": 850,
  "tool_calls_by_type": {
    "searchDocs": 450,
    "createOrder": 78,
    "createGithubIssue": 12
  },
  "openai_tokens_used": 125000,
  "active_chat_sessions": 15
}
```

### Cost Management

- [ ] Set up OpenAI usage alerts
- [ ] Configure spending limits on APIs
- [ ] Monitor token usage per conversation
- [ ] Review vector database costs
- [ ] Set up cost dashboards
- [ ] Plan for scaling costs

## Post-Deployment

### Immediate (First 24 Hours)

- [ ] Monitor error rates closely
- [ ] Check performance metrics
- [ ] Review user feedback/complaints
- [ ] Test all features in production
- [ ] Verify analytics are tracking
- [ ] Check API costs
- [ ] Be available for urgent fixes

### First Week

- [ ] Analyze conversation logs for issues
- [ ] Identify common user queries
- [ ] Review tool usage patterns
- [ ] Check for any security issues
- [ ] Optimize slow queries
- [ ] Refine system prompts based on real usage
- [ ] Update documentation as needed

### Ongoing

- [ ] Weekly review of error logs
- [ ] Monthly cost analysis
- [ ] Regular security audits
- [ ] Update documentation as features change
- [ ] A/B test prompt improvements
- [ ] Gather user feedback systematically
- [ ] Re-index docs when content updates

## Rollback Plan

In case of critical issues:

- [ ] Document rollback procedure
- [ ] Keep previous version deployable
- [ ] Test rollback procedure
- [ ] Have contact list for incidents
- [ ] Define rollback triggers (error rate, response time, etc.)

Example rollback trigger:
```
IF error_rate > 5% for 5 minutes THEN rollback
IF p95_response_time > 3 seconds for 10 minutes THEN rollback
IF openai_api_failures > 50% for 2 minutes THEN rollback
```

## Feature Flags

Consider using feature flags for safer deployments:

```typescript
const features = {
  enableOrderCreation: process.env.ENABLE_ORDER_TOOL === 'true',
  enableGithubIssues: process.env.ENABLE_GITHUB_TOOL === 'true',
  enableRAG: process.env.ENABLE_RAG === 'true'
};

// In tool definitions
const tools = [
  features.enableRAG && searchDocsTool,
  features.enableOrderCreation && createOrderTool,
  features.enableGithubIssues && createGithubIssueTool
].filter(Boolean);
```

## Compliance & Legal

- [ ] Privacy policy includes AI chat disclosure
- [ ] Terms of service cover AI interactions
- [ ] GDPR compliance reviewed (if applicable)
- [ ] Data retention policy defined
- [ ] User consent for chat logging obtained
- [ ] PII handling procedures in place

## Performance Benchmarks

Target metrics for production:

- **Response time**: < 2 seconds (p95)
- **Availability**: > 99.5%
- **Error rate**: < 1%
- **Tool success rate**: > 95%
- **Vector search latency**: < 500ms

## Success Criteria

Define what success looks like:

- [ ] X% of users engage with copilot
- [ ] Average conversation length > Y messages
- [ ] User satisfaction score > Z
- [ ] Order conversion rate via copilot
- [ ] Support ticket deflection rate

## Emergency Contacts

Document key contacts:

- **On-call engineer**: [Name, Phone, Email]
- **DevOps team**: [Contact info]
- **OpenAI support**: [Account/Support details]
- **Database provider**: [Support contact]
- **Hosting provider**: [Support contact]

## Final Checks

Before going live:

- [ ] All checklist items above completed
- [ ] Stakeholders notified of launch
- [ ] Support team trained on new feature
- [ ] Marketing materials ready (if applicable)
- [ ] Announcement prepared
- [ ] Launch monitoring plan in place

## Day of Launch

1. **T-1 hour**: Final system check
2. **T-0**: Deploy to production
3. **T+5min**: Verify deployment successful
4. **T+15min**: Test all features manually
5. **T+1hour**: Review initial metrics
6. **T+6hours**: First monitoring review
7. **T+24hours**: Post-launch review meeting

---

**Remember**: It's better to launch with fewer features that work perfectly than many features with issues. You can always enable more tools later via feature flags.
