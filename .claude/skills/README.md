# Skills Directory

This directory contains **Claude Code skills** - reusable knowledge modules that provide specialized guidance, templates, and best practices for common development tasks in this project.

## What are Skills?

Skills are structured markdown files that Claude Code can invoke to access detailed implementation guides, patterns, and lessons learned. They serve as living documentation that:

- **Capture proven patterns** and best practices from completed work
- **Provide ready-to-use templates** for common tasks
- **Document lessons learned** and gotchas to avoid
- **Enable consistent implementation** across the project
- **Speed up development** by providing instant access to detailed guides

## How to Use Skills

Skills are automatically available when using Claude Code. When you start a task, Claude will:

1. **Check for relevant skills** based on your request
2. **Invoke appropriate skills** to access detailed guidance
3. **Follow the patterns** and templates provided
4. **Update skills** with lessons learned after completing tasks

You can also manually invoke a skill by asking Claude to use it:
```
"Use the firebase-coffee-integration skill to help me add authentication"
"Check the logo-manager skill for logo implementation patterns"
```

## Skill Management Rules

For detailed guidelines on how to check and update skills, see **[`/claude.md`](/claude.md)** in the project root.

### Quick Reference:

**Before starting tasks:**
- ✅ Check if a relevant skill exists
- ✅ Invoke the skill to access detailed guidance
- ✅ Follow the patterns and templates provided

**After completing tasks:**
- ✅ Update relevant skills with lessons learned
- ✅ Document new patterns, gotchas, and solutions
- ✅ Add error messages and their fixes
- ✅ Include specific file paths and code examples

**Creating new skills:**
- ✅ Use the skill-creator skill for guidance
- ✅ Make skills comprehensive but concise
- ✅ Include ready-to-use templates and examples
- ✅ Focus on reusable patterns

## Skill Structure

Each skill typically contains:

```
skill-name/
├── skill.md              # Main skill content with frontmatter
├── assets/               # Templates, scripts, code examples
├── references/           # Additional documentation and guides
└── scripts/              # Automation scripts and tools
```

**Frontmatter format:**
```yaml

```

## Contributing to Skills

Skills are **living documentation** that should evolve with the project:

1. **After every completed task**, consider what was learned
2. **Update relevant skills** with new patterns and gotchas
3. **Be specific** - include file paths, line numbers, and concrete examples
4. **Keep it actionable** - focus on practical, reusable guidance
5. **Commit changes** with clear messages explaining what was learned

## Tips for Effective Skill Usage

### For Users:
- **Be specific** when asking Claude for help - mention relevant technologies
- **Ask Claude to check skills** if you're unsure whether guidance exists
- **Request skill updates** after debugging complex issues

### For Claude:
- **Proactively invoke skills** when tasks match skill descriptions
- **Follow patterns exactly** - skills contain proven approaches
- **Update skills immediately** after completing tasks while details are fresh
- **Cross-reference skills** when multiple skills apply to a task
