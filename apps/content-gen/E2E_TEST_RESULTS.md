## 🐛 Bugs Found & Fixed

### Bug #1: Missing datetime Import in IdeaService ❌ → ✅ FIXED

**Error:**
```
Failed to approve idea: name 'datetime' is not defined
```

**Location:** `backend/src/content_gen_backend/services/idea_service.py:260`

**Root Cause:**
The `approve_idea()` method uses `datetime.utcnow()` but the `datetime` module was not imported.

**Fix:**
```python
# Added to imports at line 4
from datetime import datetime
```

**Test Result:** ✅ Approval now works correctly
