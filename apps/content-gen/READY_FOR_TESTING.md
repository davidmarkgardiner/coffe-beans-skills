✅ Shows "Generating" or "Queued" header
✅ Percentage starts at 0%
✅ Updates every 2 seconds: 0% → 10% → 25% → 50% → 75% → 100%

## 🐛 If You See Issues

### Issue: Prompt is Empty in Create Tab
**Expected Logs in Console:**
```javascript
App: handleGenerateVideo called with idea: {...}
VideoCreator: Idea prop changed: {...}
VideoCreator: Auto-filling prompt with: [text]...
```

**If logs don't appear:**
- Refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R)
- Try clicking "Create Video" again
- Check if idea has a video_prompt field

**If logs appear but prompt still empty:**
- This would be a new bug - please report with console output

### Issue: Progress View Doesn't Appear
**Expected:**
- App automatically switches to progress view after clicking "Generate Video"
- You should see a progress bar, not the Create tab

**If it doesn't appear:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Try clicking "Generate Video" again
3. Check Network tab (F12 → Network) for POST to /api/v1/videos

**Workaround:**
- Go to Library tab manually
- Filter by "In Progress"
- You'll see the video generating there

### Issue: Video Won't Play
**Our 3-tier fallback should handle this:**

1. First tries: video_url field from API
2. Then tries: blob download from API
3. Finally tries: direct backend URL

**If video still won't play:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check Network tab for request to /api/v1/videos/{id}/content
3. Verify video file exists:
   ```bash
   ls -lh /Users/davidgardiner/Desktop/repo/big-3-super-agent/apps/content-gen/backend/videos/
   ```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Keep Console Open** (F12) - Watch debug logs to understand flow
2. **Don't Switch Tabs Manually** - Let the app auto-navigate
3. **Use Library for Overview** - See all videos and their statuses
4. **Try Different Models** - Sora 2 is fast, Sora 2 Pro is high quality
5. **Experiment with Prompts** - AI-generated prompts work great, but you can edit them

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate Testing
1. Test the complete workflow end-to-end
2. Verify prompt auto-fill works correctly
3. Confirm progress view appears automatically
4. Test video playback with fallback strategies
5. Try publishing a video to YouTube

### After Successful Testing
1. Generate multiple videos from different ideas
2. Experiment with different video models
3. Try creating remixes of existing videos
4. Build up your published video library
5. Track analytics on YouTube

## 📞 Need Help?

If anything doesn't work as expected, provide:

1. **Which step failed?** (News, Ideas, Create, Progress, Player, etc.)
2. **Console errors?** (F12 → Console, copy red errors)
3. **Network status?** (F12 → Network, check API calls)
4. **What you see?** (Describe or screenshot)

**Remember:** The progress view is NOT a tab - it appears automatically! Don't look for a "Progress" button in the navigation.
