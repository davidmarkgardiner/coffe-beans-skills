## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Architecture

```
Frontend (React on :5173)
    ↓
Backend (Express on :3001)
    ↓
OpenAI GPT-4o-mini
    ↓
Tool Execution (searchDocs or createGithubIssue)
    ↓
GitHub API
    ↓
GitHub Actions (with @claude mention)
    ↓

```

### Key Files Modified/Created

**Backend:**
- `server/src/server.ts` - Main backend with tool calling
- `server/.env` - Configuration (API keys, tokens)
- `server/package.json` - Dependencies

**Frontend:**
- `src/components/CoffeeCopilot.tsx` - Chat widget component
- `src/App.tsx` - Added CoffeeCopilot import

**Documentation:**
- `.claude/skills/coffee-copilot/SKILL.md` - Updated skill guide
- `.claude/skills/coffee-copilot/LESSONS_LEARNED.md` - Real-world learnings
- `NEXT_STEPS.md` - Detailed roadmap
- `README_COPILOT.md` - Quick reference guide
- `TODAYS_WORK.md` - This summary

## 💡 Key Learnings

### 1. MVP Approach Works
**Lesson**: In-memory knowledge base with simple keyword search is sufficient for testing tool calling and getting MVP running in <2 hours.

**Why it matters**: No need to set up vector database immediately. Can upgrade later.

### 2. Mode-Based Control is Essential
**Problem**: AI autonomously creating GitHub issues is dangerous.

**Solution**: Explicit mode toggle gives users control.

**Impact**:
- No surprise issues
- Better bug reports (focused mode)
- User trust

### 3. @claude Mention in Body, Not Label
**Initial mistake**: Added @claude as a label
**Correct approach**: Mention @claude in issue body text
**Why**: GitHub Actions trigger on mentions in text, not labels

### 4. Environment Variables Require Server Restart
**Common mistake**: Adding API key to .env but server still shows "Missing"
**Solution**: Kill server (Ctrl+C) and restart with `npm run dev`
**Why**: dotenv loads at startup, not dynamically

### 5. Tool Calling is Intelligent
**Observation**: AI made TWO search queries for one user question
**Example**: User asked about pour over → AI searched both "pour over brewing method" AND "pour over coffee"
**Takeaway**: OpenAI's tool calling is smarter than expected

## 🐛 Known Issues to Address

### High Priority
1. **Duplicate OPENAI_API_KEY in .env**

### Medium Priority
3. **No Rate Limiting**
   - Vulnerable to abuse
   - Add express-rate-limit

4. **Limited Knowledge Base**
   - Only 5 topics
   - Should expand to 20-25

### Low Priority
5. **Mobile Testing Needed**

## 📝 Code Snippets Worth Saving

### Mode Toggle (Frontend)
```typescript
const [bugReportMode, setBugReportMode] = useState(false);

// Toggle buttons
<button onClick={() => setBugReportMode(false)}>💬 Chat</button>
<button onClick={() => setBugReportMode(true)}>🐛 Report Issue</button>

// Send to backend
allowGithubIssues: bugReportMode
```

### Conditional Tools (Backend)
```typescript
const availableTools = allowGithubIssues
  ? tools
  : tools.filter(t => t.function.name !== 'createGithubIssue');
```

### @claude Mention (Backend)
```typescript
const bodyWithMention = `${params.body}\n\n---\n\n@claude Please investigate and fix this issue.`;
```
